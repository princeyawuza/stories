  </center> 
  I am a married woman and a mother of 3 kids. My husband is financially well off. i am working at my professional job
  and he let me with full authority and freedom to manage my finances as I wish. <br> 
  I have saved and by God's grace I have secretly accumulated a number of property of including rental, various plots of land, bodabodas for business, etc. <br>
  To be honest with you, I registered most of my property into my brother's names with fear that in case my husband divorces me, I have all my property and I move on.
  Unfortunately my brother's wife of 2 kids has recently filed for divorce and wants more than half of his property and fortune. <br>
  To make matters worse, she is aware of all property registered in her husband's name including my investments!
  And she's very serious with divorce and property sharing! <br>
  I really regret why I did this! <br>
  How can I save my investments? <br>
  Advise me. <br><br>
